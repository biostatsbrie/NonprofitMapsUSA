# NonprofitMapsUSA
I'm mapping every nonprofit in the USA. Hopefully it helps some folks find and learn more about nonprofits! All my data comes from the IRS and US Census. I'm using SAS for data management and Tableau for visualization. I thought I'd share a sneak peek.

Using data from the IRS, I made a bar chart of the primary activities of nonprofits throughout the country. Roughly 63% of nonprofits didn't say what their activities were, but I don't think that any particular category would be more or less likely to report (or not report). Therefore, I think the ratios between the activities would be the same. So I think the visual of this graph would hold true.

Here's a heatmap breakdown of the proportion of nonprofit activity per state. 27% of Mississippi's nonprofit efforts surprised me, since I thought they were always 49th in Education, but turns out that that's no longer the case!

And here's my favorite part of the project -- the interactive map! There's two maps. One tells you how many nonprofits are in each place you hover your mouse over:

And this map lets you search for anywhere in the USA that has a nonprofit:

And when you click on the place, you can see all the registered nonprofits and their category! This will make it much easier to find local nonprofits.

There's still a lot of polishing that I need to do and more features that I want to add, so there's no ETA on this project, but I'm happy with how it's going so far :)
